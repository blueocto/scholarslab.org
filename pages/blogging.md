This page celebrates our successful 2019 challenge, a "Year of Blogging". The challenge started off with Brandon Walsh and Amanda Visconti committing to write one post per month in 2019. Ammon Shepherd stepped things up early on with a series of four posts on DH archiving that were co-written with other SLab and UVA Library staff. 

We were able to reach our stretch goal of encouraging a broader revival of our blog, tied into a renewal of our website (migration from WordPress to Jekyll-generated static site, new content and info structure). Between January 1, 2019 and December 3, 2019, we wrote **58** non-announcement posts (i.e. we dind't count announcements of fellowships or workshops, just essays). Below, the board where we tracked posts via author and a 3-word summary of each post:

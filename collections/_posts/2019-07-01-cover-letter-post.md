We had planned a post on the subject of job search materials for several weeks. So long, in fact, that in the intervening weeks, a minor Twitter kerfluffle emerged on the subject. One well-meaning person aimed to share the job advice that they generally give students on the academic job market. The responses have raised a number of compelling issues. For one, framing an academic job search exclusively in terms of handy tips undervalues the degree of luck that goes into any search. Do these things, such advice seems to suggest, and the just and right meritocracy will reward you with a job (when the academic job market is anything but just and anything but a meritocracy).

1. academic market is not identical with all job markets in academic

2. refusing to share resources reinforces privileged access to resources

3. Advice on the job market should come with frank discussions about precarity

4. Students need our support
offers to aid in job searches, on and off the tenure track, should be made but they should also go beyond lists of advice.

5. support must include the work of feelings? or I don't know what to call this…

we try to emphasize that the student is smart enough, good enough, etc., that the job market is not a reflection on them, that our current jobs are kind of due to being lucky in a lottery (and every time you win a lottery it makes future lotteries easier…)

6. emphasize backup plans and talking with a career center

7. i'm not sure how we share our cover letters in this context, but still seems worth doing.

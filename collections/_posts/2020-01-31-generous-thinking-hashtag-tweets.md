Hashtag founders: 
* Hannah Alpert-Abrams [@hralperta](https://twitter.com/hralperta) ([website](http://www.halperta.com/))  
* Mimi Winick [@mimwinick](https://twitter.com/mimwinick)  
* Amanda Henrichs at [@envynoveritas](https://twitter.com/envynoveritas) ([blog](http://akhenrichs.com/blog/)) 

Hannah asks ([see whole thread here](https://twitter.com/hralperta/status/1213519198636433409)) "How can we practice #GenerousThinking for a more liberatory future?... each day, we'll be using quote tweets to share how we're implementing #GenerousThinking in our teaching, research, or scholarly service. Our goal: to find tactics and strategies for generosity for those of us who are students, ec, contingent, & alt-ac... You can share your own daily practice, or modify someone else's. We'll synthesize your ideas into a practical framework for implementation."

How to see tweets that quote a hashtagged tweet
For example, you can see tweets that quoted Hannah's first daily #GenerousThinking tweet by visiting https://twitter.com/search?q=quoted_tweet_id%3A1213519202176438273&f=live

That's:
https://twitter.com/search?q=quoted_tweet_id%
plus the tweet's ID
And I add the `&f=live` suffix at the end to make these display in reverse chronological order ("latest") rather than displaying by which recieved the most activity (likes/RTs/etc.)

## My contributions

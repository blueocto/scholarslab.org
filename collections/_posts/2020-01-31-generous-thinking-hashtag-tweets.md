The #GenerousThinking hashtag project was founded by Hannah Alpert-Abrams ([@hralperta](https://twitter.com/hralperta); [website](http://www.halperta.com/)), Mimi Winick ([@mimwinick](https://twitter.com/mimwinick)), and Amanda Henrichs ([@envynoveritas](https://twitter.com/envynoveritas), [blog](http://akhenrichs.com/blog/)), and is based on Kathleen Fitzpatrick's [book of the same title](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/generous-thinking).

Hannah asks ([see whole thread here](https://twitter.com/hralperta/status/1213519198636433409)): "How can we practice #GenerousThinking for a more liberatory future?... each day, we'll be using quote tweets to share how we're implementing #GenerousThinking in our teaching, research, or scholarly service. Our goal: to find tactics and strategies for generosity for those of us who are students, ec, contingent, & alt-ac... You can share your own daily practice, or modify someone else's. We'll synthesize your ideas into a practical framework for implementation."

## My contributions
The following are my ([@literature_geek](https://twitter.com/literature_geek)) #GenerousThinking hashtag project tweets, tweeted daily throughout January 2020. (I'm just pasting in the text, but you can read the tweets in order [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40literature_geek%20%23generousthinking&src=typed_query&f=live) if you wish to RT or bookmark.)

**Thinking through discomfort tweeting my acts with/as #GenerousThinking**
I'm used to tweeting about my work. People can't learn about your work if you don't share, and I very much want to learn these things about others! (Can always unfollow...) So, I found it interesting I did have similar "tooting my own horn" discomfort re:this good hashtag project

<3 the book title & hashtag. But I realized I was reading the hashtag, solely on my own draft tweets, like "I declare that this thing I do is generous!" rather than the intended "I'm trying to contribute to a more generous scholarship this way"

(Weird, because I very much don't read the hashtag on anyone else's tweets as the former rather than the latter.)

Re my thread on realizing my uncertainty sharing my work w/#GenerousThinking hashtag project=similar to how I've heard folks feel about tweeting *any* of their work, realized what helps me w/freely sharing my in-progress work & thoughts on here:

When I tweet any of my work/thoughts, I'm not positioning it to myself as something that's best practice, or that I'm certain I'd like to see more work similar to, or as something that doesn't have major rethinking+change in its future. A water cooler, not a press release...

I frame my regular schol tweet updates to myself just as something I want to let others know I'm working on (for feedback, hearing about resources & more folks to read/cite, for self-motivation to continue work), avoiding self-judgement on current quality as barrier to sharing

Guessing that's 1 #GenerousThinking hashtag team @hralperta @mimwinick @envynoveritas intent: we share what we're trying daily towards a better world, not Perfect Big Solutions but w/attention to stuff that is less communicated bc it's smallscale inprogress contextspecific etc.
 
Anyway, wanted to share those thoughts in case they help anyone feel more comfortable sharing what they're thinking, working on, etc. on here. I'd love to learn more from folks who haven't shared as much of their work, when/if that feels right to you.
 
(Twitter caveat always worth noting: I have both confidence+safety sharing scholarship online; some from privileges e.g. being white & w/job security, less of a target for disrespect+abuse+plagiarism. There are reasons to choose not to share work, or to not have that choice.)

If you get similar qualms, helped me to frame this as: what's something I did today toward a more caring community, that I want to do more? That I'd like to discuss with others & improve? Which of my beliefs about acting w/care as an administrator would I like others to consider?

I'm also going to try doing 2 tweets/day-ish: 1 about my own approach, and 1 about something I see someone else doing and want to celebrate+amplify.

E.g. #GenerousThinking: I've seen each @ScholarsLab
 staffer recognize colleagues elsewhere in the library doing good or making our work possible. Potlucks, doughnuts; emailing praise to share w/supervisors of staff outside the lab + submit to library's reward+recognition system.

**Re: [@hralperta](https://twitter.com/hralperta/status/1213519202176438273)'s tweet:**
_Today in #GenerousThinking, I talked with colleagues about the tension between our anger at the academy, and our hope for the future of the humanities. How can we change our daily work to turn that anger towards a common good? How are you implementing #GenerousThinking?_

I am heartened by folks tying anger+hope together toward action like this. Lately, framing my negative feelings about the academy as anger rather than sadness has moved my thinking from "too bad I can't change that" to "here's at least 1 small thing I can do"

When I've had less institutional power & the academy was rough on me, I appreciated when folks were angry for me rather than sad. "Angry" might not be the perfect term (it's just how I've been mentally filing this resolution), but: using the emotion as fuel rather than a weight.

When I'm able to act these days it's often because I have some institutional power that makes action possible, easier, and/or more productive. And folks with less power in the academy couldn't safely be angry nor act in the same situation.

I dig this #GenerousThinking project's focus on what folks w/o as much institutional power can do. I think I'll sometimes share actions that aren't available to all, and hope I can stay aware that those choices are easier, safer, more successful etc. because of power+privilege.

Something that clicked for me was @mchris4duke
's sketch  (https://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/2016/09/17/talking-at-harvard-about-libraries-and-social-justice/) emphasizing personal & local action. #GenerousThinking for me means combining broader advocacy w/challenging myself to do better by my immediate communities—e.g. inside our library & lab.

E.g. After the white supremacist rally here (which included harm to library staffers), I was frustrated by some official messaging, and the absence of a plan for dealing w/rally-related physical or online harassment of staff

I talked about this w/folks like my AUL, because I'm in a position to safely address some how some (very well-intentioned!) post-rally messaging felt off. I think in the past, I would have stopped there & spent more time just being frustrated w/decisions above me.

Instead, I tried to see what I could do closer to home—myself, and w/colleagues—and I think that was a better approach for me. E.g. made sure folks on my team know I will back them up vs. harassment; discussed w/colleagues what that support could look like.

E.g. walking someone to their car, scanning someone's mentions for abuse, recognizing the ways the library value "we serve everyone" can be at odds w/nurturing a space that rejects hate, celebrates diversity, supports community care.

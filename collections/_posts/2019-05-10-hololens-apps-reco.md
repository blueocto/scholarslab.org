To help you gather app ideas from the over three hundred HoloLens apps in the Windows app store, we have selected a few great free apps to start with in the following categories:
  - Exploration 
  - Education 
  - Entertainment & Games


## Exploration 

  1. [*Magic Window*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/magic-window/9nzcfqjv9vh7?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)

      Magic Window, created by 4 Fun Studio Inc., offers a choice of seven scenes, including the pyramids, outer space with aliens, a city with fireworks, and more. What’s great about this app is that it assigns different song effects to match the scene. The player can walk near the window to look closer and explore broader angles of the scene that can’t be seen from farther away.
      
   2. [*HoleLenz*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holelenz/9p7mr081n921?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
    
      HoleLenz is created by VoxelKei. Using this app, the player can air tap to drill holes of various sizes to get an aerial view of a mountain scene at different times—day, night, and more.
      
   3. [*Land of Dinosaurs*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/land-of-dinosaurs/9nblggh50zx1?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
    
      Land of Dinosaurs, created by Zengalt, is a short narrative about dinosaurs. It’s amazing to see dinosaurs walk past you while you are lying in bed. A voice introduces the dinosaurs along with the play. The app is both fun and educational. You can even create your own 3D content with an app called Vyzn from the same company.

  4. Similar Apps 
  
        a. [*Walk the World*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/walk-the-world/9p6svqqcp2sq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
        
        Want to know what it feels like to explore the world by walking on a map? This app shows an aerial map or satellite view, and you can tell the app where you want to go. You can say “help” to bring up the Help menu when you need guidance.
        
        b. [*HoleLenz Gate*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holelenz-gate/9pjkj8mtjmjf?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
        
        This app is similar to HoleLenz and is created by the same company, but instead of showing you a window view, it allows you to drill a gate to go between your location and a scene.
        
        c. [*HoloQuarium*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/holoquarium/9nblggh513pd?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) 
        
        With this app, you can have numerous tropical fish swimming in your room!

We had planned a post on the subject of job search materials for several ~weeks~ months, now. So long, in fact, that in the intervening time, a minor Twitter kerfluffle emerged on the subject. One person aimed to share the job advice that they generally give students on the academic job market. The responses have raised a number of compelling issues. For one, framing an academic job search exclusively in terms of handy tips undervalues the degree of luck that goes into any search. Do these things, such advice seems to suggest, and the just and right meritocracy will reward you with a job (when the academic job market is anything but just, and anything but a measure of merit).

1. academic market is not identical with all job markets in academic

2. refusing to share resources reinforces privileged access to resources

3. Advice on the job market should come with frank discussions about precarity

4. Students need our support
offers to aid in job searches, on and off the tenure track, should be made but they should also go beyond lists of advice.

5. support must include the work of feelings? or I don't know what to call this…

we try to emphasize that the student is smart enough, good enough, etc., that the job market is not a reflection on them, that our current jobs are kind of due to being lucky in a lottery (and every time you win a lottery it makes future lotteries easier…)

6. emphasize backup plans and talking with a career center

7. i'm not sure how we share our cover letters in this context, but still seems worth doing.

Other stuff:
share jobs with students who tell us they're looking, rather than flooding Slack #fellows channels with reminders of job market stress
I’m wondering whether I’d feel better if we did what we planned but stored it in a repo we could point people to, rather than have it on the blog? I don’t know whether that’s illogical—maybe it’s kind of like our sharing job ads with students who have told us they’re looking, rather than flooding a #fellows channel with job reminders? => but then fewer people see
Think about intent vs. impact, always: job advice is often "well meaning", but what matters is the environment it creates, who it tells is worthwhile as they are, who it empowers with information, who it implicitly tells is wrong
I think there’s a way to not be prescriptive about it, but instead talk about how to best communicate one’s personal strengths in a letter.
maybe part of this stuff feeling wrong is it’s broadcast format/lack of context for individual situations? Like, we’re not going to stop advising our students how to work with the market as it is, although we’re also committed to leavening that advice with affirmation of them as scholars and people and helping them do what they value even if they can’t do that as their main job
framing it as, here’s what we’ve tried to do when on hiring committees and reviewing cover letters? (here’s the kind of stuff we feel we shouldn’t evaluate on, and here’s what we look for?)
i think sometimes CV sharing can make people feel “oh i don’t have these experiences - how could this possibly be relevant to me? i must just not be qualified”
we can maybe talk in reference to the CV, but keeping it on the cover letter i think will help illuminate a genre that is more mysterious without activating that same feeling

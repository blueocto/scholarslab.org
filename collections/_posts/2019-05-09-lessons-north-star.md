Designing the best virtual reality (VR) experience requires having the best 3-dimensional (3D) content that is suitable for your VR experience. Not all 3D content forms are equal, so it is important to distinguish between them. A helpful way to look at a project or experience is to first determine whether it seeks to **create** spatial content or whether it seeks to **capture** spatial content.

## Content Creation

Creating 3D content in VR is particularly useful when the object you need is simple, geometric structures with specific spatial references. For example, one user might choose to create 3D content for their environment simply by establishing a geometric plane as the floor. Note here the difference between **created** content (i.e. the plane) and **captured** content which we will soon discuss. This process of user construction can be done repeatedly to create the desired experience. The two main methods discussed here are manual sketching and VR modeling. 

Manual sketching is the most traditional method, which uses software like Sketchup, Autodesk Maya, and Rhino 3D. These are standard computer-aided drawing (CAD) tools that content designers use to create objects such as 3D models, architectural drawings, gaming props and animations.

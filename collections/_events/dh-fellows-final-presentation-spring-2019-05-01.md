Final presentation of the 2018-2019 digital humanities. Presentations by Kelli Shermeyer and Sean Tennant from 10:30-12:00 with lunch provided following the talks.

Kelli Shermeyer's Abstract:

This presentation will discuss the performance possibilities, theoretical cruxes, and technical difficulties of using motion capture and augmented reality technologies in theatrical performance. My project, Digital Skriker, explores how these increasingly accessible technologies might change both the ways we think about documenting and archiving movement and the kinds of immersive and interactive performances theater artists are able to create. This talk traces the process of rendering a scene from Caryl Churchillâ€™s _The Skriker_ (1994) in Unity, relating the various challenges that arose to the kinds of technical and aesthetic questions frequently considered by theater artists. How do the capabilities of motion capture enable us to blur boundaries between performance, film, archive, and game?

Join us for our third annual symposium on Feminist DH! The speakers are:

*Gabriela Baeza Ventura* is an Associate Professor of Hispanic Literature in the Spanish department at the University of Houston. 

*Dr. Carolina A. Villarroel* is the Brown Foundation Director of Research of the _Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage_ Project at the University of Houston, where she also teaches literature at a graduate and undergraduate level.

Gabriela and Carolina's talk is titled “US Latina Legacy: Feminism and Representation in the Archive”. This talk will discuss the presence of US Latinas in American culture. We will present on the legacy of the work of the _Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage_ Program in uncovering, locating and disseminating the written legacy of Latinos in the United States. We will focus on narratives that reveal the active and longstanding participation of Latinas in the culture, history, politics, etc. in the United States as well their role in the feminist movement. The talk will include a preview of a digital network that features women in US serial publications from 1808-1960.

*Quinn Dombrowski* is the Academic Technology Specialist in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages at Stanford University.

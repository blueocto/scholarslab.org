Gabriela and Carolina's talk is titled “US Latina Legacy: Feminism and Representation in the Archive”. This talk will discuss the presence of US Latinas in American culture. We will present on the legacy of the work of the _Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage_ Program in uncovering, locating and disseminating the written legacy of Latinos in the United States. We will focus on narratives that reveal the active and longstanding participation of Latinas in the culture, history, politics, etc. in the United States as well their role in the feminist movement. The talk will include a preview of a digital network that features women in US serial publications from 1808-1960.

Her article “What Ever Happened to Project Bamboo?” reflects on the rise and fall of that effort.

In _Putting the Humanities PhD to Work_ Katina L. Rogers grounds practical career advice in a nuanced consideration of the current landscape of the academic workforce. Drawing on surveys, interviews, and personal experience, Katina explores the evolving rhetoric and practices regarding career preparation and how those changes intersect with admissions practices, scholarly reward structures, and academic labor practicesâ€”especially the increasing reliance on contingent labor. Katina invites readers to consider how graduate training can lead to meaningful and significant careers beyond the academy.

Katina L. Rogers is Co-Director of the Futures Initiative and Director of Programs and Administration of HASTAC at The Graduate Center, City University of New York. 

Katina is joined in presenting by Cihan Tekay, a doctoral candidate in cultural anthropology. Cihan is writing her dissertation is on the political economy of electrification and its repercussions in daily life in the Ottoman Empire and Turkey from 1890 to 1940. She is also a Futures Initiative graduate fellow.

Join us for the first MakerGrounds Maker Showcase! This is a showcase of projects made by students, staff, faculty, and UVA community members. Come listen to lightning talks about the process of making, the pitfalls and successes. Network with other makers. Learn about the resources available at UVA. And come see the awesome things that people make on Grounds.
